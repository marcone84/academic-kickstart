 abstract = {Prior research has suggested the possibility of marginalization of religious students on college campuses and the marginalization of nonreligious individuals in society more generally. In this article, the authors examine perceived marginalization of religious and nonreligious college students on and off a college campus in the southeastern United States. The authors find that there is not a significant difference in perceived experiences of marginalization on the college campus, and nonreligious students report significantly more perceived experiences of marginalization off the campus. The forms of marginalization on and off campus are generally that of microaggressions, such as insults, jokes, and exclusion. The authors conclude by discussing some of the implications of their findings for colleges and universities.},
